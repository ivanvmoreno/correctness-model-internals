                Julie read 12 x 2 = 12*2=2424 pages today. So she was able to read
                a total of 12 + 24 = 12+24=3636 pages since yesterday. There are 120
                - 36 = 120-36=8484 pages left to be read. Since she wants to read
                half of the remaining pages tomorrow, then she should read 84/2 =
                84/2=4242 pages.\nFinal answer: $\\boxed{42}$\n---\nQuestion: Mark
                has a garden with flowers. He planted plants of three different colors

                and purple flowers. How many flowers does Mark have in his garden?\n
                Reasoning: There are 80/100 * 10 = 80/100*10=88 more purple flowers
                than yellow flowers. So in Mark's garden, there are 10 + 8 = 10+8=1818
                purple flowers. Purple and yellow flowers sum up to 10 + 18 = 10+18=2828
                flowers. That means in Mark's garden there are 25/100 * 28 = 25/100*28=77
                green flowers. So in total Mark has 28 + 7 = 28+7=3535 plants in his

                purple. There are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow
                and purple flowers. How many flowers does Mark have in his garden?\n
                Reasoning: There are 80/100 * 10 = 80/100*10=88 more purple flowers
                than yellow flowers. So in Mark's garden, there are 10 + 8 = 10+8=1818
                purple flowers. Purple and yellow flowers sum up to 10 + 18 = 10+18=2828
                flowers. That means in Mark's garden there are 25/100 * 28 = 25/100*28=77
                green flowers. So in total Mark has 28 + 7 = 28+7=3535 plants in his
                garden.\nFinal answer: $\\boxed{35}$\n---\nQuestion:"

                answer in this format: $\\boxed{answer}$\nHere are some examples to
                help you understand the format:\n---\nQuestion: Weng earns $12 an
                hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting.
                How much did she earn?\nReasoning: Weng earns 12/60 = $12/60=0.20.2
                per minute. Working 50 minutes, she earned 0.2 x 50 = $0.2*50=1010.\n
                Final answer: $\\boxed{10}$\n---\nQuestion: Julie is reading a 120-page
                book. Yesterday, she was able to read 12 pages and today, she read
                twice as many pages as yesterday. If she wants to read half of the
                remaining pages tomorrow, how many pages should she read?\nReasoning:
                Julie read 12 x 2 = 12*2=2424 pages today. So she was able to read
                a total of 12 + 24 = 12+24=3636 pages since yesterday. There are 120
                - 36 = 120-36=8484 pages left to be read. Since she wants to read
                half of the remaining pages tomorrow, then she should read 84/2 =
                84/2=4242 pages.\nFinal answer: $\\boxed{42}$\n---\nQuestion: Mark
                has a garden with flowers. He planted plants of three different colors
                in it. Ten of them are yellow, and there are 80% more of those in
                purple. There are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow
                and purple flowers. How many flowers does Mark have in his garden?\n
                Reasoning: There are 80/100 * 10 = 80/100*10=88 more purple flowers
                than yellow flowers. So in Mark's garden, there are 10 + 8 = 10+8=1818
                purple flowers. Purple and yellow flowers sum up to 10 + 18 = 10+18=2828
                flowers. That means in Mark's garden there are 25/100 * 28 = 25/100*28=77
                green flowers. So in total Mark has 28 + 7 = 28+7=3535 plants in his
                garden.\nFinal answer: $\\boxed{35}$\n---\nQuestion:"
